  text: 'In October of 2018 I decided to professionalize a career in Tech by attending the Ruby/Rails/React course at Epicodus. My decision to professionally transition myself out of Manufacturing and into the Tech industry was rooted in the acknowledgment of a lifelong passion and fascination in software. Somewhere between building media servers for friends, building/operating an array of cryptocurrency mining rigs, and writing software for Burning Man I realized that I needed to support my inherent passion for software development and enroll in a program that would channel this interest in the most effective, fulfilling and professional way. Tech is my passion, and I look forward to participating in this incredibly exciting industry.'

    description: 'This app was the first to see real world adoption and use. It is a Python/Django app and was developed to solve a specific issue that plagued my team of volunteers at the annual Burning Man Event. Prior to its implementation, shift keys were transferred from the outgoing shift to the incoming shift via a mutually agreed-upon hiding location. This caused many problems with lost and misplaced shift keys, frequently resulting in delays to critical aspects of our customer\'s operation. keyCatch replaced the manual hand-off process through the use of a large electronic locker/dropbox system that logs key removal and deposit events for a given set of users. This system has reduced lost-key events by more than 50% since its initial introduction and has become an integral part of the event\'s operation.',
